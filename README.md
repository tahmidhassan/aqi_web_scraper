# aqi_web_scraper
Python Web Scraper for Air Quality Index Data from "aqicn.org" 

It is possible to use the requests module to directly scrape data off the web. The code for this is commented out. 

However, the website tables are dynamic, and data is not in the html. So go ahead and select the table you want - and then copy paste the html source code of the entire page into index.html and then run the file. Make sure you select the desired year range.
